Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This release addresses some of the recent failing checks due to changes
in json-ld dependency.  Apologies we were unable to address these by your
previous deadline to avoid being archived.  We believe everything should
be fixed now.  As always, details in NEWS.md.

Thanks!

Carl Boettiger
