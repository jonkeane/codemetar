root. Default guess is current dir.}

\item{use_filesize}{whether to try to estimating and adding a filesize by using
\code{base::file.size()}. Files in \code{.Rbuildignore} are ignored.}

\description{
write out a codemeta.json file for a given package.  This function is
basically a wrapper around create_codemeta() to both create the codemeta
object and write it out to a JSON-LD-formatted file in one command. It can
also be used simply to write out to JSON-LD any existing object created with
\code{create_codemeta()}.
}
\details{
\strong{Why bother creating a codemeta.json for your package?} R packages
encode lots of metadata in the \code{DESCRIPTION} file, \code{README}, and other
places, telling users and developers about the package purpose, authors,
license, dependencies, and other information that facilitates discovery,
adoption, and credit for your software. Unfortunately, because each
software language records this metadata in a different format, that
information is hard for search engines, software repositories, and other
developers to find and integrate.

By generating a \code{codemeta.json} file, you turn your metadata into a
format that can easily crosswalk between metadata in many other software
languages. CodeMeta is built on \href{https://schema.org}{schema.org} a
simple \href{https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data}{structured data}
format developed by major search engines like Google and Bing to improve
discoverability in search. CodeMeta is also understood by significant
software archiving efforts such as \href{https://www.softwareheritage.org/}{Software Heritage} Project, which seeks to
permanently archive all open source software.

For more general information about the CodeMeta Project for defining
software metadata, see \url{https://codemeta.github.io}. In particular, new
users might want to start with the \href{https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/}{User Guide}, while those looking to
learn more about JSON-LD and consuming existing codemeta files should
see the \href{https://codemeta.github.io/developer-guide/}{Developer Guide}.

\strong{How to keep codemeta.json up-to-date?} In particular, how to keep it
up to date with \code{DESCRIPTION}? \code{codemetar} itself no longer supports
automatic sync, but there are quite a few methods available out there.
Choose one that fits well into your workflow!
\itemize{
\item You could rely on \code{devtools::release()} since it will ask you
whether you updated codemeta.json when such a file exists.
\item You could use a git pre-commit hook that prevents a commit from
being done if DESCRIPTION is newer than codemeta.json.
\itemize{
\item You can use the \href{https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit}{precommit package} in which
there’s a “codemeta-description-updated” hook.
\item If that’s your only pre-commit hook (i.e. you don’t have one
created by e.g. \code{usethis::use_readme_rmd()}), then you can
create it using
}
}\if{html}{\out{
<!-- end list -->
}}
\if{html}{\out{<div class="r">}}\preformatted{script = readLines(system.file("templates", "description-codemetajson-pre-commit.sh", package = "codemetar"))
usethis::use_git_hook("pre-commit",
                     script = script)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\itemize{
\item You could use GitHub actions. Refer to GitHub actions docs
\url{https://github.com/features/actions}, and to the example workflow
provided in this package (type \code{system.file("templates", "codemeta-github-actions.yml", package = "codemetar")}). You can use
the \code{cm-skip} keyword in your commit message if you don’t want this
to run on a specific commit. The example workflow provided is setup
to only run when a push is made to the master branch. This setup is
designed for if you’re using a \href{https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#the-main-branches}{git flow}
setup where the master branch is only committed and pushed to via
pull requests. After each PR merge (and the completion of this
GitHub action), your master branch will always be up to date and so
long as you don’t make manual changes to the codemeta.json file, you
won’t have merge conflicts.
}

Alternatively, you can have GitHub actions route run \code{codemetar} on each
commit. If you do this you should try to remember to run \verb{git pull}
before making any new changes on your local project. However, if you
forgot to pull and already committed new changes, fret not, you can use
(\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18930527/difference-between-git-pull-and-git-pull-rebase/38139843#38139843}{\verb{git pull --rebase}})
to rewind you local changes on top of the current upstream \code{HEAD}.\if{html}{\out{

\section{Technical details}{

If pkg is a codemeta object, the function will attempt to update any
fields it can guess (i.e. from the DESCRIPTION file), overwriting any
existing data in that block. In this case, the package root directory
should be the current working directory.

When creating and writing a codemeta.json for the first time, the function
adds "codemeta.json" to .Rbuildignore.

\examples{
\donttest{
codemeta <- tempfile()
write_codemeta("codemetar", path = codemeta)
}
}
