**Why bother creating a codemeta.json for your package?** R packages encode lots of metadata in the `DESCRIPTION` file, `README`, and other places, telling users and developers about the package purpose, authors, license, dependencies, and other information that facilitates discovery, adoption, and credit for your software.  Unfortunately, because each software language records this metadata in a different format, that information is hard for search engines, software repositories, and other developers to find and integrate.

By generating a `codemeta.json` file, you turn your metadata into a format that can easily crosswalk between metadata in many other software languages.  CodeMeta is built on [schema.org](https://schema.org) a simple [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) format developed by major search engines like Google and Bing to improve discoverability in search.  CodeMeta is also understood by significant software archiving efforts such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) Project, which seeks to permanently archive all open source software.

For more general information about the CodeMeta Project for defining software metadata, see <https://codemeta.github.io>.  In particular, new users might want to start with the [User Guide](https://codemeta.github.io/user-guide/), while those looking to learn more about JSON-LD and consuming existing codemeta files should see the [Developer Guide](https://codemeta.github.io/developer-guide/).
